Histograms are commonly used for univariate distributions and boxplots are a historical graphic for multivariate visualization.\nLoad some data library(tidyverse) ## Warning: package \u0026#39;readr\u0026#39; was built under R version 4.1.1 library(ggformula) library(palmerpenguins) theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16)) head(penguins) ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_… body_mass_g sex ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; ## 1 Adelie Torge… 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male ## 2 Adelie Torge… 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema… ## 3 Adelie Torge… 40.3 18 195 3250 fema… ## 4 Adelie Torge… NA NA NA NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 5 Adelie Torge… 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema… ## 6 Adelie Torge… 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male ## # … with 1 more variable: year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; Here is a histogram exploring the body mass of the penguins.\ngf_histogram(~ body_mass_g, data = penguins, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;) ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

An alternative is the density curve which uses kernel density estimation to get a curve. The details of the kernel density estimation isn’t overly important, and it is possible to change the estimation. The default estimation works pretty well however.\ngf_density(~ body_mass_g, data = penguins) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;) ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).  Multivariate Thinking In general, exploring univariate distributions are important, but in most situations, it is also important to explore these distributions in a multivariate framework. This means, exploring the distribution of the outcome attribute by other attributes.\n** Insert interactive components**\nThe boxplot is one way to do this.\ngf_boxplot(@@ ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;$$\u0026quot;) Boxplots are simple representations, but since they are only based on 5 numbers, can be too simple.\nDensity plots for each group could be explored, but can get difficult to interpret with many groups. Violin plots (or a related sina plot) are the solution.\ngf_violin(@@ ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins, fill = \u0026#39;gray80\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;$$\u0026quot;) gf_violin(@@ ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins, fill = \u0026#39;gray80\u0026#39;, draw_quantiles = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;$$\u0026quot;) library(ggforce) gf_sina(body_mass_g ~ @@, data = penguins) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(y = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;$$\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% gf_refine(coord_flip()) gf_violin(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins) %\u0026gt;% gf_sina(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(y = \u0026quot;Body Mass (in grams)\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;$$\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% gf_refine(coord_flip())   ","date":1631664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631664000,"objectID":"b1cd2cbce64aa732c94ed8207717c3a3","permalink":"https://bbcstats.brandonlebeau.org/materials/01-visualize-dist/","publishdate":"2021-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/materials/01-visualize-dist/","section":"materials","summary":"Visualizing Distributions","tags":null,"title":"Visualizing Distributions","type":"book"}]
